The Domain Adaptation Toolbox for Medical data analysis (DomainATM) is an open-source software package that is designed for fast facilitation and easy customization of domain adaptation and harmonization/normalization methods for biomedical data analysis.

1. DomainATM is designed to facilitate researchers using different methods for feature-level and image-level biomedical data adaptation, data visualization, and analysis performance evaluation.

2. DomainATM is implemented in MATLAB with a user-friendly graphical interface, and it consists of a collection of popular domain adaptation algorithms that have been extensively applied in the fields of biomedical data analysis and computer vision.

3. DomainATM enables the users to develop and test their own data adaptation methods through scripting which greatly enhances its utility and extensibility.
